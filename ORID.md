# ORID Reflection

## 1. **Objective**
- Learned HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
- Studied RESTful API design (CRUD operations).
- Explored Spring Boot controllers (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`).

## 2. **Reflection**
- RESTful design simplifies API maintenance and scalability.
- Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code, speeding up development.

## 3. **Interpretation**
- Mastering HTTP and RESTful design is key to building effective APIs.
- Spring Boot provides powerful tools for request handling and routing.

## 4. **Decision**
- **Short-term**: Continue practicing RESTful API design in Spring Boot.
